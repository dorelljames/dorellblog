Recently, someone came in such surprise. Things began to change; more of like a chaos really. I don&#8217;t know but it happened in all of a sudden and here I am right now, stuck in a middle of something which feels like heaven and hell.

&#8220;Days shall pass&#8221;, they say. And it shall be but while I&#8217;m too focused on how I feel and most of things, she on the other side doesn&#8217;t have the slightest care and is the exact opposite. Of course, it&#8217;s not that it is her fault for not feeling the same way like I do but how I wish this was easier and that she likes me too.

These past few days, I can honestly say that I was out of my cool (lost control). The first few nights were just terrible as I have had trouble getting myself to sleep. How can you possibly remove someone in your head?
