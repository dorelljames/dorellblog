_There's really nothing more I can tell you how much I like this shirt. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-tongue"></span>_

Forgive my ignorance, it's just this is the first branded <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">&#8220;Google&#8221;</a> shirt I have in my entire life. Got this from this year's <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/ckeeo387gvbvjiobgonnq91b2b4" target="_blank">Google IO Extended Cebu 2013</a> which of course took place here in Cebu, Philippines. You may ask, &#8220;What's the big deal?&#8221; To most people, there's really nothing special about it but for me it's something I can treasure in my life. If you'll ask why, then it's just I simply believe in Google; in everything Google does. Though I honestly don't know their mission/vision but what I care about is the thing I'm seeing as to how they are trying to change the world by leading and innovating. And I guess that's just the reason why most people around the globe love Google.

Yet, before I let go here let me tell you something about this shirt. I don't usually like wearing loose shirts as I'm not really comfortable with it but knowing that its a &#8220;Google&#8221; shirt as I can call it, I'm amazed as how I made an exception and walked through the whole day wearing it. I guess now I understand how it is important a thing of value means to you.

It's just crazy how it drive me to get all the way. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>
