_There&#8217;s really nothing more I can tell you how much I like this shirt. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-tongue"></span>_

Forgive my ignorance, it&#8217;s just this is the first branded <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">&#8220;Google&#8221;</a> shirt I have in my entire life. Got this from this year&#8217;s <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/ckeeo387gvbvjiobgonnq91b2b4" target="_blank">Google IO Extended Cebu 2013</a> which of course took place here in Cebu, Philippines. You may ask, &#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal?&#8221; To most people, there&#8217;s really nothing special about it but for me it&#8217;s something I can treasure in my life. If you&#8217;ll ask why, then it&#8217;s just I simply believe in Google; in everything Google does. Though I honestly don&#8217;t know their mission/vision but what I care about is the thing I&#8217;m seeing as to how they are trying to change the world by leading and innovating. And I guess that&#8217;s just the reason why most people around the globe love Google.

Yet, before I let go here let me tell you something about this shirt. I don&#8217;t usually like wearing loose shirts as I&#8217;m not really comfortable with it but knowing that its a &#8220;Google&#8221; shirt as I can call it, I&#8217;m amazed as how I made an exception and walked through the whole day wearing it. I guess now I understand how it is important a thing of value means to you.

It&#8217;s just crazy how it drive me to get all the way. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>
