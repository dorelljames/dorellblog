Today is the first time I was able to go out of the office early. Twenty minutes past five in the afternoon is when I took off the building and walked down to wait for a short trip going home. Well, it&#8217;s just like my normal days but the only thing that&#8217;s new is the time I&#8217;m going home which is quite early in my case. Minutes and more minutes had passed but still nothing and the waiting just gets worse than I initially thought. And so I decided to walk back and took the other route I used to when I go home.

While walking and seeing the night nearly setting down, I couldn&#8217;t stop myself thinking about a lot of things. Some things that made me wonder, some things that I can&#8217;t find answers for quite some time now and some matters that somehow affect me not in a positive way. But there&#8217;s one great thing that I came to realize at that moment.

> If you follow the flow, surely you will get to where you might want to be but if you take yourself out, you&#8217;ll find things are simply amazing when you&#8217;re the one steering the wheel.

The logic is simple. If I simply waited there and just waited until I&#8217;ll be able to get a ride going home then things will be pretty plain simple and yes surely I&#8217;ll reach my destination but it&#8217;s this decision I made to settle out and walk down the road, enjoy the night sat down, let my eyes wander to the things I haven&#8217;t seen for a while and my heart rejoice for the joy I feel at the moment which made things totally different. It&#8217;s truly amazing and I thank God for this short trip going home that I learned something memorable and might be worth sharing to others. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>
