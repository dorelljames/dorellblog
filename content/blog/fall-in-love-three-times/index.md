Before you grow old, you must fall in love 3 times.

Once you must fall in love with your best friend, ruining your friendship forever. This will teach you who your true friends are, and the fine line between friendship and more.

Once you must fall in love with someone you believe to be perfect. You will learn that no one is **perfect**, and that you should never be treated as any less than you deserve.

And once you must fall in love with someone that is **exactly like you**. It will tell you how wonderful is it to finally meet someone who holds the same thoughts as you do. It&#8217;s like looking at a mirror and not expecting any judgement in return, only acceptance of who you are. This will teach you about who you are, and who you want to be.

And when you&#8217;re through with all that, you learn that **love is only a concept and is not something that can be defined, and it is different to each person that experiences it**. And you will learn to respect each and every person on this earth, knowing that everyone only wants to be loved.

To know that love is not a trophy to be won, no love can last forever, and that one must be **open to have affection for everyone**, is the true meaning of love. Love without bounds, without thoughts, fiercely, calmly, gently, deeply. **Giving into the moment and giving everything you have, your trust, your emotions, your vulnerability, your past, your aspirations**, is the nearest I can think of being the definition of love.
