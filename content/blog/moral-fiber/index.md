It takes effort to build something but it's useless if it's not appreciated. And even worst if it's not meant to be. It's like you're trying to fit that square peg in a round hole. We don't hold control to whatever the person thinks, believes or chooses to do. Let them have the freedom to choose what they like and respect their decision. Because if you love them, even it hurts more than hell, you must be happy to accept what they choose to. Things won't be easy for sure but if that's what happiness is for them, let it be. You choose to open your heart and share your life with someone and it doesn't matter if they hurt you; what matters is that they made you happy somehow. Love doesn't need to expect something in return. Love is love and I don't know how to describe it more exactly but one thing's for sure, it has the power to turn our worlds upside down.

What was the craziest thing you've done lately?

The question reminds me of that thing they call &#8220;Moral Fiber&#8221;.

> It's about finding that one thing you really care about. That one special thing that means more to you than anything else in the world. And when you find her, you fight for her. You risk it all, you put her in front of everything, your life, all of it. And maybe the stuff you do to help her isn't so clean. You know what? It doesn't matter. Because in your heart you know, that the juice is worth the squeeze. That's what moral fiber's all about.

Now, I don't know what to think nor where to put myself. Feels like I'm stuck in the middle of something. I think I should let go of all these (thoughts) for now. There's a life that I should be taking care of and I don't think it still matters now; it's all said and done. Things have changed and is changing moving forward, it's constant. Only then maybe in the future I'll have my answer if it's really worth it. Still, I'm thankful for having to feel such wonderful feeling. Let's see! <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>
