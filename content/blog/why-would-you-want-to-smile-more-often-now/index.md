Do you SMILE more than 20 times per day? Yes? Great! But did you know that children do more than 400 times a day in average? You must have known now why their day is so much lively and better than yours. Sweet. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>

Smiling is for everyone, it's been proven to be healthy and most of all it's free. Watch this TedTalk by Ron Gutman and discover the hidden power of smiling. Have a great day! <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>
