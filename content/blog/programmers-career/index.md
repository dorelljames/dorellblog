I stumbled on this quote last night while I was browsing premium themes. Now, you might not agree with me but I believe it's true. I'll just leave it here and maybe you can and try to see if this goes the same for you &#8211; developers / programmers out there? <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>
