And so the much awaited day has come! YES, I&#8217;m single but NO, I&#8217;m not going to be bitter here. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>

I&#8217;m happy to know that the people around me are happy and filled with love in their hearts. Share the love&#8230;

To those who:

**\* Have been in love for a couple of time <span class="wp-font-emots-heart"></span>**

Stay true to your partner. Make everyday special in your own little ways. Make them happy always. Cuddle as much as you can. Love as there&#8217;s no tomorrow. Take care of your partner. And lastly ask this, &#8220;_Can I give more?_&#8221; That&#8217;s how you assess your love. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>

**\* Newly in love <span class="wp-font-emots-heart"></span>**

I certainly know how it feels. The magic of love will keep you alive. It feels like time flies and it&#8217;s always never been enough. There are a lot of things you&#8217;ll get to know of your partner, a lot of things to share, a lot of things to come along the way. But what&#8217;s keeping the relationship alive? It&#8217;s simply about taking the time to understand and fix things together.

**\* Single <span class="wp-font-emots-heart"></span>**

I know you believe in love. Yes you are, no people in this world don&#8217;t long to be loved. That&#8217;s a certain thing. Don&#8217;t worry, don&#8217;t be desperate, take your time for it&#8217;s not about when, it&#8217;s about WHO. Because you&#8217;ll never know when is the right time to love but you&#8217;ll know deep in your heart someday that HE/SHE&#8217;s the one.

_Happy Hearts day to all. Share the love & enjoy the rest of the day <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>_
