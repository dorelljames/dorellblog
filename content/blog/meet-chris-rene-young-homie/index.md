I'll call this as **&#8220;Video of the Year&#8221;** simply because it's awesome and truly one inspiring reality audition in the history of X-Factor year 2011.

Most of you might not know Chris Rene well, right? But do you know who's the author of the song &#8220;Young Homie&#8221; which goes like with the famous intro:

&#8220;Ahh, yeah, hey

Ahh, yeah, hey yow yow yow

Ahh, yeah, yea, yea, yea yea, c'mon.&#8221;

I know right? It's Chris Rene. He's such an awesome artist and a real person who managed to changed his life. What else can I say? For the next 5 minutes, I just want you to watch the video and hopefully you enjoy. Thanks <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>
