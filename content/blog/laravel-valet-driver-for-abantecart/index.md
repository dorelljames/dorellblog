So today I&#8217;ve stumbled myself working with <a href="http://www.abantecart.com/" target="_blank">AbanteCart</a> on my dev machine running El Capitan OS X. I&#8217;ve been using <a href="https://github.com/laravel/valet" target="_blank">Laravel Valet</a>Â since it was initially released due to how it made things so easy on my end. If you&#8217;re working on a WordPress site and other PHP-based apps, I encourage you to check it out and spend a good 20 minutes to get it up and running. I promise, it&#8217;ll make your lives easier as a developer. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>

But hey, let&#8217;s go back. I got halted by the fact that I need to run AbanteCart &#8211; an opensource eCommerce platform that&#8217;s really promising as well. Anyhow, let&#8217;s cut the chase, valet doesn&#8217;t support AbanteCart out of the box and I was left with no choice but to make things work.

Fast forward minutes later, I have finally created a custom driver for AbanteCart and if you&#8217;re on the same boat like me, you can use my work below to save time and don&#8217;t bother yourself tinkering and tinkering and end up worst wasting your time.

Here&#8217;s <a href="https://gist.github.com/dorelljames/2325b191dd050c67a105bd7235befd99" target="_blank">a link to the gist that you can grab at GitHub</a>. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>

And oh before I forgot, just save this file to **~/.valet/Drivers** in your machine.

Enjoy, hope that helps!
