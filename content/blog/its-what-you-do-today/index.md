> Things may come to those who wait. But only the things left by those who hustle. &#8211; Abraham Lincoln

Most people might not able to see this clearly, but I do hope you realize that TODAY is the most important part of your life. Yes, it's true that there's something we can look up tomorrow but it's insignificant for nothing's gonna happen until you start doing something. And if you haven't realized this, when you're just sitting there and doing nothing, the world doesn't stop and wait for you. Think about your dreams, goals, your family and loved ones, and even yourself. Tomorrow? No, tomorrow is just a day after today, after NOW and it's a thing you're not even sure of. But believe me, the sure thing you'll gonna do today is think, decide, stand up and do the things you need to do. We may have our own problems and worries but it doesn't or should not stop us to do what we are ought to do. Miracles happen to those who believe, but those who succeed weren't just sitting there and did nothing. If you believe in God, then same goes as well.

_For NOTHING is void and there's not a thing you can get about it but SOMETHING is a thing, a certain one and you can have or get it. Don't delay the future you've been wanting to, it's now, TODAY and most importantly NOT TOMORROW._
