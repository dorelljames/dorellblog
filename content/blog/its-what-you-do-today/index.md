> Things may come to those who wait. But only the things left by those who hustle. &#8211; Abraham Lincoln

Most people might not able to see this clearly, but I do hope you realize that TODAY is the most important part of your life. Yes, it&#8217;s true that there&#8217;s something we can look up tomorrow but it&#8217;s insignificant for nothing&#8217;s gonna happen until you start doing something. And if you haven&#8217;t realized this, when you&#8217;re just sitting there and doing nothing, the world doesn&#8217;t stop and wait for you. Think about your dreams, goals, your family and loved ones, and even yourself. Tomorrow? No, tomorrow is just a day after today, after NOW and it&#8217;s a thing you&#8217;re not even sure of. But believe me, the sure thing you&#8217;ll gonna do today is think, decide, stand up and do the things you need to do. We may have our own problems and worries but it doesn&#8217;t or should not stop us to do what we are ought to do. Miracles happen to those who believe, but those who succeed weren&#8217;t just sitting there and did nothing. If you believe in God, then same goes as well.

_For NOTHING is void and there&#8217;s not a thing you can get about it but SOMETHING is a thing, a certain one and you can have or get it. Don&#8217;t delay the future you&#8217;ve been wanting to, it&#8217;s now, TODAY and most importantly NOT TOMORROW._
