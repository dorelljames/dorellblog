Sometimes we don&#8217;t know exactly how we feel. We tend to confuse ourselves believing that we love someone yet we only just admire them. In some other cases, we deny to ourselves convincing that we only like a person yet knowing wholeheartedly that we&#8217;re starting to like them or better yet loved them already.

I guess it&#8217;s just really true that when you love someone you just can&#8217;t really explain why. At times, you get jealous and feel like you wanted to own someone&#8217;s laughter and happiness; to you only. You thought you were one tough man but the circumstances prove it that you&#8217;re not. Your mind goes at war thinking and trying to win countless battles of thoughts which aren&#8217;t just right. And the last most important thing is you just can&#8217;t stop and you don&#8217;t know why.

_In front of the person you love, your heart beats faster_

_But in front of the person you like, you get happy._

_In front of the person you love, winter seems like spring_

_But in front of the person you like, winter is just a beautiful winter._

_If you look into the eyes of the one you love, you blush_

_But if you look into the eyes of the one you like, you smile._

_In front of the person you love, you can&#8217; t say everything on your mind_

_But in front of the person you like, you can._

_In front of the person you love, you tend to get shy_

_But in front of the person you like, you can show your ownself._

_You can&#8217;t look straight into the eyes of the one you love_

_But you can always smile into the eyes of the one you like._

_When the one you love is crying, you cry with them_

_But when the one you like is crying, you end up comforting._

_The feeling of love starts from the eye_

_And the feeling of like starts from the ear._

_So if you stop liking a person you used to like_

_All you need to do is cover your ears,_

_But if you try to close your eyes_

_Love turns into a drop of tear and remains in your heart forever after._
