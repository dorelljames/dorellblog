My life may not be what I really wanted it to be for I have chose to choose the road that I&#8217;m quite confident and have weighed things based on what I consider is the best. I&#8217;m not one smart guy that&#8217;s able to easily see and take the best route in fulfilling my goals and dreams. I also make quite a lot of mistakes just like every human in this planet. Still, I&#8217;m wishing as much as I do to have a good life but what could it be if I were not afraid? What could it be if we&#8217;re able to do the things we want?

#### Who Moved My Cheese?

If you&#8217;ve read the story, I think I have to admit that I am much like Hem who can&#8217;t move on and is afraid of what could be the life outside &#8211; way beyond what I have right now? I may have a good reason that I couldn&#8217;t just take that risk because I&#8217;m the one bringing food at the table but given this sentiment we can&#8217;t answer what life could be if I can do the things I always wanted without anything holding me back?

##### A Good Life, What is it?

Let&#8217;s first understand what a good life is for me. Well, a good life for me is simple as an ordinary life of someone who is free to do the things he/she wants. Given the complexity of life and the reality we&#8217;re in, we&#8217;ll not be able to achieve total freedom in life. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean an easy life but definitely just a better life. I&#8217;m quite impatient at times and want results immediately but lately I understand that things doesn&#8217;t happen overnight.

##### The Happy Thoughts?

I feel blessed to have happy thoughts in my head yet I feel there&#8217;s still something lacking and I know now the answer. It&#8217;s the fun I missed of being stuck in a corporate job where <a href="http://dorellwp.localhost/personal/do-the-work-you-love/" target="_blank">I don&#8217;t honestly feel exciting anymore</a>. While there are still quite some things that interest me, on the other side I imagine a world of exploration and discoveries and having good minded people who think alike where you learn and share those exciting things around. It&#8217;s just totally awesome. I wish I could find that one job that I really wanted to. Be in a enthusiast solid team aiming to create something incredible. And one day, if you meet me somewhere, you&#8217;ll recognize me saying, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re the one who created this product X, right?&#8221; Wow, wow, wow&#8230;

##### Travel & Do It A Lot

I&#8217;m not really that one type of talkative person and I can&#8217;t connect deeply with a person in an instant but at least I know to myself that I&#8217;m honest and I don&#8217;t try to pretend to be anyone else. It might be also due the fact that I lack the experience to talk and share something back. So, if I could travel to wherever I want, it would just totally be awesome. You&#8217;ll really gain a lot of new things meeting new people, culture and etc. Wooh!

##### What I really want?

Well, what I do really want? One tough question that I&#8217;m not so sure until now myself. I know I love to code and I am much more inclined with web development compared to software development. Guess, there&#8217;s still quite a lot of things that sparks interest in me like Android and would it feel to be ROM developer? What and how does it feel to be able to create a product or an app that a lot of people uses. How does it feel to designed a solid core base solution that everyone adapts? Tell me&#8230;

##### Sing and \`Gig

At times I feel sad, I sing a song I even don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s true and I sing the thoughts that just comes out my mouth naturally. What could be if I have learned more about the guitar? Learned the piano and a lot more? Wow, singing here and doing gigs from here and there is just totally cool and it rocks! <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>

Now, let&#8217;s go back to the reality that I am situated right now. I have probably shared a couple of thoughts that doesn&#8217;t matter to you but I&#8217;m glad I have come up with those. It makes me feel excited with of the life I could have been. I know it&#8217;s not quite late and soon a new journey will come. &#8216;Til then my friends, see for the next chapter of my life. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>
