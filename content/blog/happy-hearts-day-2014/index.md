It's the 14th of February (Hearts Day, Valentines, Couples Day, etc.) and of course the most awaited day has finally come. Here's a compilation of the Q&A I read on Quora that seems to fit the day. You'll love them for sure. <span class="wp-font-emots-emo-happy"></span>

    What's the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for you?
  </h1>
  
  <div class="thb-toggle-content">
    <p>
      My wife and I have been married for thirteen years. A few years back, I was so sick I could barely get out of bed. On day three, I lost the ability to keep anything down in my stomach.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Foolishly, I ate a small supper with my wife and our newborn baby (six months old). After supper I went to bed and fantasized about dying. As I went in and out of consciousness I could hear Tara (my wife) staying up with our baby, who finally fell asleep at 2:00 AM. No sooner had Tara laid down for a much deserved eight hours of sleep, my stomach wretched. I ran to the bathroom, but didn't make it. I lost the contents of my stomach and threw-up on pretty much everything. With the last bit of energy I had I crawled onto the middle of our living room floor.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When I looked up, my wife was up. Without a word, and with no look of annoyance or anger or anything else, she took towels from a closet, filled a wash basin with water, and spent the next forty-five minutes cleaning up the horrid mess I'd just made. By this time, our baby was crying again. Tara got her from her crib and took her to our rocking chair.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When the sun came up, I saw that Tara was asleep in the rocking chair with our beautiful baby girl in her arms.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That, in my humble opinion, is true romance.

    How do i show the one i love how much i love her?

    <p>
      Try the <strong>'thought, word, deed'</strong> principle. You are already thinking about how much you love her &#8211; that's the thought part.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now you need to put your love into words, either printed or spoken, it didn't really matter, as long as it's sincere (don't forget &#8211; you can rewrite).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Finally, find some way of expressing your love for her by doing something special and/or selfless &#8211; something romantic and giving, something lovely and kind.

    What are some great real-life love stories that people have heard?
  </h1>
  
  <div class="thb-toggle-content">
    <p>
      A friend of mine died two years ago from melanoma. He rang me the day he got his diagnosis and told me he had been given six weeks to live but he was feeling OK. He only just made the six weeks. He decided to get his life in order for his family.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      He came to work two days later to pack up his things and send his final farewell emails. It was his 56th birthday so we decided to have a cake. He blew out the candles and one of the girls got a bit flustered and excited and asked him what he wanted for his birthday, he said 'very short books'. He was a funny guy and well liked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A week before he died he rang from his bed to tell me that he was able to get an early pay out from his superannuation and that he had paid the house off for his wife. He said he thought he would never live to see the day. He only just made it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The most amazing thing he did for his wife though. He wrote a whole heap of post it notes and hid them all around the house. He hid them in places that he knew she would not have the heart to shift, move or clean for sometime, such as his hobby room, clothes,shed etc. The notes said such things as 'Spend the money and enjoy yourself' 'Sell my car you don't need it' 'Move on' I will Love you Always'. She was still finding them nine months after his death and they are now some of the most cherished things she has. He remained connected to her way after he passed. Gene was a cool guy.

    Is it normal that I feel jealous whenever i find my girl laughing with other guys?
  </h1>
  
  <div class="thb-toggle-content">
    <p>
      Normal ? Yes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Good ? No.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My recommendation ? Turn the jealousy on its head and make it something good. Here's how that works.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Think about <strong>why</strong> you are jealous. It's because you <strong>REALLY</strong> like your girlfriend, right ? You love her a lot ! You want her to appreciate you and be with you. And you're worried that those other men are a threat to your relationship.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That's the first key right there: <strong>The fact that you really love your girlfriend, is a good thing, not a bad thing!</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Let's look at the other part. Are they a threat ?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What kind of girlfriend would you rather have ?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Would you prefer a girlfriend who stays with you because she knows no other attractive males at all, and therefore she doesn't have much choice but to stay with you ?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Or would you prefer a girlfriend who knows and laughs with many attractive men, but who, despite knowing all these other men stays with you, <strong>because she prefers you, and because she loves you?</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What is the best compliment ?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>I stay with you because I have no choice, or at least no good alternative.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Or:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>I do have a choice, and I do have good alternatives. My choice is you.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Think about it a little bit, hell, think about it a LOT.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Can you see the beauty ?
    </p></p>

    What is the sweetest thing you have ever seen or heard from someone?
  </h1>

    <p>
      1. Both my parents are visually challenged. One day, when I was feeling low, I asked my father to go on a walk with me. While walking, he just randomly said, &#8220;You know, Aastha, I have heard a lot of people say that you've grown up into an extremely beautiful young woman. If I were to magically get the power of vision some day, I know I will be able to recognize you. Not because I'll look for a pretty girl but because I'll look for a girl who exudes love and warmth.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I know you want to make us proud. But I want you to know that we already are very proud of you. I am proud of my little girl who has become a good human being. That was all I had ever wanted.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      2. One of my teachers gave this card to me
    </p>
    
    <p>

    </p>
    
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you for being kind. <br /> Please pass this to the next person you see performing an act of kindness.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I passed it on to a friend. A few weeks later, I received the card back from someone else with a note: <br /> &#8220;Hey! I want to give this to you because you're the only real friend I've ever had. <br /> You stood up for me. You've inspired me and it was because of you that I didn't kill myself. I can never thank you enough.&#8221;
