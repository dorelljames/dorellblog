I'm personally challenged to do my first post on my site right now. I've been thinking a lot of what should it be or how it should be. Guess I've found the answer now and this is it.

If someone asks, &#8220;What is motivation for you?&#8221; Do you think you can state things clearly? I guess not. Getting caught into our daily lives often make Â things normal and most of the time we come to ignore the important things in life.
