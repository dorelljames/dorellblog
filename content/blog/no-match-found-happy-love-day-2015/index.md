_No match found_

He was a lover of Mathematics.  
She was the theater club president.

He was unnoticeable and shy.  
She was audacious and confident.

The day she came to return notes, he resented inside,  
How a guy always had to ask a girl out, from his side,  
For her beauty always left him tongue-tied.

He opened the notebook,and the first page said:  
_"Can we see each other over coffee?"_ with her name and number beside.

**13 years later**, they still have nothing in common;  
_Except the surname of his own._
