### No match found

He was a lover of Mathematics.

She was the theater club president.

He was unnoticeable and shy.

She was audacious and confident.

The day she came to return notes, he resented inside,

How a guy always had to ask a girl out, from his side,

For her beauty always left him tongue-tied.

He opened the notebook,and the first page said:

&#8220;Can we see each other over coffee?&#8221; with her name and number beside.

13 years later, they still have nothing in common;

Except the surname of his own.
