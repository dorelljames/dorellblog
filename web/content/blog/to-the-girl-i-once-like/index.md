It's probably more than three years now since I first saw this beautiful young lady who once in my life I liked. I can still remember that day when and still amazed at how at . I guess it was quite obvious and that she knew that. It doesn't matter, I honestly felt alive that day; she seems close yet so far away.

Her very nature of being quite herself yet seems so happy together with friends
