When you love someone you&#8217;ll never understand why. No matter how you really try to understand what the hell is happening, you&#8217;ll never get an answer for that.

> Love is an uncertainty wrap in a box where heaven or hell could be found.

This must be the first time I&#8217;ve been like this and no matter how I try to control myself, there are just times I&#8217;m way out of control. Recently, I have come to realize a couple of things.

1. Never tell the person you like them too soon. Let things develop naturally.
2. Sometimes being too kind is not too good at all.
3. Let her be; you don&#8217;t own her &#8211; I always wanted her to be mine and that I hoped she feels the same the way I do. But it shouldn&#8217;t be like that. She has her own life and capable of living on her own to enjoy and do whatever she wants. So, let her be. Else, be happy for her in everything she do. Support her and be for her at times she might need someone like you.
4. Be inspired, not the other way around
5. Think less, worry less &#8211;
6. Never assume; ask &#8211;
7. No matter how you like her, if she doesn&#8217;t, she doesn&#8217;t &#8211;
