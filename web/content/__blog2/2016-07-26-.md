I always thought that life must be lived like just passing by and it&#8217;s okay not to do things. But then I realized where&#8217;s the fun in that? That satisfaction you get from achieving feats. Does it not count as happiness? You know I have all these things that I need to do in my life and they&#8217;re all pretty clear that I need to do them for the better but why I am holding myself and delay them? I understood that I had this all justification to myself that maybe I don&#8217;t want these things at all that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m slacking off but now it&#8217;s pretty clear that well, maybe I&#8217;m slacking off because I think I have all the time in the world and it&#8217;s still fine today, tomorrow, and for another tomorrow. If I haven&#8217;t watched &#8220;Your Lie In April&#8221; &#8211; an anime series starred by a piano prodigy and telling how his life have changed when he met the girl who put colors in his life and totally changed him to bring out the best in him.
